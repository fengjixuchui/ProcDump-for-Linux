# ProcDump [![Build Status](https://oss-sysinternals.visualstudio.com/Procdump%20for%20Linux/_apis/build/status/microsoft.ProcDump-for-Linux?branchName=master)](https://oss-sysinternals.visualstudio.com/Procdump%20for%20Linux/_build/latest?definitionId=10&branchName=master)
ProcDump is a Linux reimagining of the classic ProcDump tool from the Sysinternals suite of tools for Windows.  ProcDump provides a convenient way for Linux developers to create core dumps of their application based on performance triggers.

# Installation & Usage 

## Requirements
* Minimum OS:
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS 7
  * Fedora 26
  * Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* `gdb` >= 7.6.1
* `zlib` (build-time only)

## Install ProcDump
### Via Package Manager [preferred method]

#### 1. Register Microsoft key and feed
```sh
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
```
#### 2. Install Procdump
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install procdump
```

### Via `.deb` Package
> Pre-Depends: `dpkg`(>=1.17.5) 

#### 1. Download `.deb` Package
#### Ubuntu 16.04
```sh
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod/pool/main/p/procdump/procdump_1.0.1_amd64.deb
```

#### Ubuntu 14.04

```sh
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-trusty-prod/pool/main/p/procdump/procdump_1.0.1_amd64.deb
```

#### 2. Install Procdump
```sh
sudo dpkg -i procdump_1.0.1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -f install
```
### Uninstall
#### Ubuntu 14.04+
```sh
sudo apt-get purge procdump
```
## Usage
```
Usage: procdump [OPTIONS...] TARGET
   OPTIONS
      -C          CPU threshold at which to create a dump of the process from 0 to 100 * nCPU
      -c          CPU threshold below which to create a dump of the process from 0 to 100 * nCPU
      -M          Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump
      -m          Trigger when memory commit drops below specified MB value.
      -n          Number of dumps to write before exiting
      -s          Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10)
   TARGET must be exactly one of these:
      -p          pid of the process
      -w          Name of the process executable
```
### Examples
> The following examples all target a process with pid == 1234

The following will create a core dump immediately.
```
sudo procdump -p 1234
```
The following will create 3 core dumps 10 seconds apart.
```
sudo procdump -n 3 -p 1234
```
The following will create 3 core dumps 5 seconds apart.
```
sudo procdump -n 3 -s 5 -p 1234
```
The following will create a core dump each time the process has CPU usage >= 65%, up to 3 times, with at least 10 seconds between each dump.
```
sudo procdump -C 65 -n 3 -p 1234
```
The following will create a core dump each time the process has CPU usage >= 65%, up to 3 times, with at least 5 seconds between each dump.
```
sudo procdump -C 65 -n 3 -s 5 -p 1234
```
The following will create a core dump when CPU usage is outside the range [10,65].
```
sudo procdump -c 10 -C 65 -p 1234
```
The following will create a core dump when CPU usage is >= 65% or memory usage is >= 100 MB.
```
sudo procdump -C 65 -M 100 -p 1234
```

> All options can also be used with -w instead of -p. -w will wait for a process with the given name.

The following waits for a process named `my_application` and creates a core dump immediately when it is found.
```
sudo procdump -w my_application
```

## Current Limitations
* Currently will only run on Linux Kernels version 3.5+
* Does not have full feature parity with Windows version of ProcDump, specifically, stay alive functionality, and custom performance counters
